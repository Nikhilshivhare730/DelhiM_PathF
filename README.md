# DelhiMetro-ShortestPath
Project Overview:
Develop a Delhi Metro Path Finder application that helps users find the shortest or most efficient path between two stations. The project will involve the use of data structures and algorithms (particularly graph algorithms), object-oriented programming, and possibly a simple GUI for user interaction.
Features:
1) Shortest Path Calculation:
   Find the shortest path between two stations using algorithms like Dijkstra's or A*.
2)Fare Calculation:
   Calculate the fare based on the distance traveled or the number of stations passed.
3)Station Information:
   Provide information about each station, including facilities and connections.
4)Route Visualization:
   Visualize the route on a map or a graphical representation of the metro network.
5)User Interface:
   Implement a user-friendly interface for users to input their source and destination stations.
Technologies:
Programming Language: Python,C++
Data Structures: Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix)
Algorithms: Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS
GUI Framework: Tkinter (Python), JavaFX (Java), or a web-based interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript
